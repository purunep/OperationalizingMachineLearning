# Operationalizing Machine Learning
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, I have build and deploy model and consume the endpoint using REST api call. For building, deploying the model I am using Microsoft Azure Auto ML and also using Azure ML pipeline. For the training I am using Bank marketing training data set from the following link : https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv 
The classfication model goal is to predicts if a client will subscribe to a fixed term deposit with a financial institution. 

## Architectural Diagram
Here is the Architectural diagram that shows all the main step from creating a dataset to Auto ML and choosing the best model from the trained model. After we choose the best model , we published and consume the endpoint.
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 


## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
